# Pykit

This repo is an exploration of the inner mechanisms of the package [Pykitml](https://pykitml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
It's a beautifully designed pacakge that relates closely to what Pytorch does.

Apart from that it's just generally great to be able to inspect the Optimizers and models and understand what's going on 
under the hood.

On Optimizers there is a neat [Article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-visual-explanation-of-gradient-descent-methods-momentum-adagrad-rmsprop-adam-f898b102325c) that covers intuition behind the algorithms and math.
